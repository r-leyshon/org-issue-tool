The number of paragraphs in sections indicated with <variable> can be flexible.
The scraped results will be pasted together (concatenated with " " separator).

Please avoid including additional list sections. But feel free to include additional paragraph content.

If using nested lists (sublists) then 2 levels works fine. But the third level doesn't scrape well, so please avoid.

Separate **Bold headers** from content with a carriage return by pressing enter. Avoid the markdown syntax of 2
spaces at the end of a line.
